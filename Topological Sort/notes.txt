 1. basially works on directed ggraph 
 2. it is linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u and v then u appears before v
 3. it should be an acyclic graph
 So, To find the Topological sorting for a graph, we just have to find in-degrees of each vertex and order the nodes from least in-degree to the highest.
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
2 Methods to solve this-

Using DFS Based Algorithm
Using Kahn's BFS Based Algorithm
